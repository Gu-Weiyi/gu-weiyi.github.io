I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the College of  Environmental Sciences and Engineering at **[Peking University]**(https://www.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor Yue Qin, and expect to graduate in Summer 2026. I received both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Environmental Planning and Management from **[Nanjing University]**(https://www.nju.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Professor Beibei Liu.

My research focuses on **evaluating climate impacts on the water-food nexus system and designing cost-effective adaptation strategies to build climate-resilient systems**. Among others, my work has revealed potential negative environmental externalities and inequities associated with widely adopted adaptation measures, such as long-term, short-distance crop migration (e.g., Nature Food, 2024) and short-term, long-distance agricultural trade (e.g., Nature Water, 2024, cover article). With comprehensive cross-disciplinary training, I am committed to **fostering synergies between climate change adaptation and environmental impacts mitigation, ultimately promoting sustainable and inclusive development for all**.

I have served as a project leader for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, PhD program) and have been recognized as a PKU–BHP Carbon and Climate Wei-Ming Scholar and an Honorable Mention recipient of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) Young Scientists Summer Program (YSSP). I have received several awards, including the Tang Xiaoyan Environmental Science Innovation Scholarship, the Qian Yi Environmental Award, the Outstanding Master’s Thesis Award of Jiangsu Province, and the National Scholarship. I have served as a referee for several scientific journals, including Environmental Research Letters and npj Sustainable Agriculture, and have received the Outstanding Reviewer Award from IOP Publishing. I have also served as a co-convener of the AGU General Assembly 2024.

**I am currently seeking postdoctoral positions starting in Fall 2026, focusing on the climate, water, and agri-food systems. Please feel free to reach out if you think there could be a good fit!**
